# The Muxt Manifesto

- **Force no dependencies on users.**

  The standard library should be the only **required** library in generated code.

- **Generate simple readable code.**
  
  Code should use useful identifiers where possible and inline aggressively. 

- **Reduce package pollution by generated code** 

  Users should feel good about adding code to the same packages as generated code. 

- **Collaboration, Not Isolation**

  The simpler the tool, the fewer technical barriers stand between you and your collaborators.
  Everyone can contribute, review, and refactor templates and generated code with confidence.

- **Enable Ruthless Refactoring**

  If something grows cumbersome, you can remove or reshape it without fear of toppling the entire stack.
  Making structural changes to templates should cause as few surprises as possible when generating code.

- **Empower Iteration**

  Finding product market fit is hard.
  Fast feedback loops are essential.
  Muxt is built for continuous discoveryâ€”quickly scaffold your routes, test them, and adapt.
