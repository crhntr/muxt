# 1 - Use Decision Records

## Context

There are a lot of implicit decisions in this codebase.
I have been working on it for a while and would like to not forget why I made things the way they are.
Generally, it is not ideal to backfill decisions because it takes time but I want to do this little by little to show my work.

## Decision

Backfill decision records little by little.

## Status

Decided

## Consequences

There will be decisions documented way after the relevant code.
To mitigate this, I will need to do some git history spelunking.
