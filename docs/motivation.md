# Motivation

I’m not a huge fan of TypeScript or modern frontend frameworks.
Partly it’s a skill gap—I haven’t invested the time to learn them deeply.
But I also want the benefits these tools provide: polished UIs without an entire extra layer in my stack.

**Enter [HTMX](http://htmx.org/).** It brings me closer to the slickness of Vue or Svelte without forcing a massive
front-end rewrite.
Combined with Go, `sqlc`, PostgreSQL, and now Muxt, I get a powerful server-rendered workflow that bridges a datastore
and user interface seamlessly.

I **love** writing Go. It’s a joy to make useful tools in a straightforward language.

I’m wary of overloading projects with dependencies—especially after years of dealing with regulated environments where
every library bump *could be* a headache.

Yes, LLMs help write boilerplate, but I still prefer writing code that’s maintainable for **humans**.
Code generation is just another productivity boost—if it helps me build more reliable apps faster, that’s a win.
I get a real thrill tinkering with abstract syntax trees and regex solutions that generate clean, testable Go code.

I use Muxt because it supports the workflow I love; it is simple, direct, and powerful enough to let me write and understand
code quickly so that I can touch grass.
